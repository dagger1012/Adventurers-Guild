## Revolutionizing Computer Science Education

**The Adventurers Guild** is a gamified developer marketplace that connects students and developers with real-world projects from companies and NGOs. Adventurers progress through ranks (F to S), earn XP, and get paid by completing Quests — actual development tasks commissioned by real organisations.

Part of the **Open Paws** ecosystem, integrating with the Open Paws Bootcamp and Internship Programme.
